# Machine Learning Resources

A collection of ML resources in Python

### Data Visualization

- [Bokeh](https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh) - Bokeh is a Python library for creating interactive visualizations for modern web browsers. The documentation for this library can be found [here](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/).
- [Streamlit](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit) - Streamlit turns data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes. All in pure Python. No frontâ€‘end experience required. The documentation for this library can be found [here](https://streamlit.io/).
- [Dash](https://github.com/plotly/dash) - Written on top of Plotly.js and React.js, Dash is ideal for building and deploying data apps with customized user interfaces. The documentation for this library can be found [here](https://dash.plotly.com/introduction).


### General Purpose (Tabular) Machine Learning

### Survival Analysis


- [lifelines](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/lifelines) - a complete survival analysis library, written in pure Python. The documentation for this library can be found [here](https://lifelines.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

- [scikit-survival](https://github.com/sebp/scikit-survival) - a Python module for survival analysis built on top of scikit-learn. The documentation for this library can be found [here](https://scikit-survival.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/00-introduction.html).

- [pysurvival](https://github.com/square/pysurvival/) - an open source python package for Survival Analysis modeling built upon the most commonly used machine learning packages such as NumPy, SciPy and PyTorch. The documentation for this library can be found [here](https://square.github.io/pysurvival/).


### AB Testing \& Experimentation \& Causal Inference

- [Causal ML](https://github.com/uber/causalml) - provides a suite of uplift modeling and causal inference methods that allows user to estimate the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) or Individual Treatment Effect (ITE) from experimental or observational data. The documentation for this library can be found [here](https://causalml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about.html).

- [EconML](https://github.com/Microsoft/EconML) - applies machine learning techniques to estimate individualized causal responses from observational or experimental data. The suite of estimation methods provided in EconML represents the latest advances in causal machine learning. The documentation for this library can be found [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/econml/).


- [doWhy](https://github.com/py-why/dowhy) - An end-to-end library for causal inference. The documentation for this library can be found [here](https://py-why.github.io/dowhy/).
