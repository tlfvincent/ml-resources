# Machine Learning Resources
A collection of ML resources in Python


### Data Visualization

### General Purpose (Tabular) Machine Learning

### Survival Analysis

- [lifelines](https://lifelines.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - a complete survival analysis library, written in pure Python.
- [scikit-survival](https://scikit-survival.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/00-introduction.html) - a Python module for survival analysis built on top of scikit-learn.
- [pysurvival](https://square.github.io/pysurvival/) - an open source python package for Survival Analysis modeling built upon the most commonly used machine learning packages such as NumPy, SciPy and PyTorch.

### AB Testing \& Experimentation

- [Causal ML](https://causalml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about.html) - provides a suite of uplift modeling and causal inference methods that allows user to estimate the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) or Individual Treatment Effect (ITE) from experimental or observational data.
